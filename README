# 📈 Quantitative Forex Signal Generation Engine

## Project Summary

This project is an autonomous system designed to generate high-conviction trading signals for major Forex currency pairs. The architecture integrates robust data processing, advanced machine learning (ML) modeling, and automated cloud-based deployment (DevOps), providing a comprehensive solution for quantitative market analysis.

The system emphasizes risk mitigation by filtering market data through fundamental analysis (economic events) before applying an ensemble of three distinct XGBoost Regressors for directional prediction.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights & Demonstrated Skills

| Area | Demonstrated Skill / Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Machine Learning** | **Ensemble Modeling (XGBoost)**, Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning (`GridSearchCV`), Time-Series Forecasting | Utilized multiple models with distinct feature sets to enhance predictive stability and reduce variance, demonstrating proficiency in advanced regression techniques. |
| **Data Engineering** | Data Acquisition (APIs), Data Cleaning (`pandas`), **Complex Feature Generation** (RSI, MACD, Pivot Points, ATR) | Developed a scalable data pipeline to integrate market data and calculate over 30 technical indicators critical for algorithmic trading strategies. |
| **DevOps & Automation** | **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**, Cron Scheduling, Environment Secrets Management | Implemented a reliable, scheduled daily workflow using GitHub Actions, ensuring consistent and autonomous model execution and signal delivery. |
| **Risk Management** | **Fundamental Analysis Filtering**, **Signal Consensus Logic** | Incorporated a proactive risk layer by excluding trading during high-impact economic events and requiring **100% agreement** across all three models for signal finalization. |

## ⚙️ System Architecture & Workflow

### 1. Fundamental Safety Check
The `investpy` library is used to scan the economic calendar for all relevant currency nations (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) over the next 24 hours. Any currency pair exposed to a **High-Impact** event or excessive **Medium-Impact** volatility is immediately quarantined and excluded from the analysis for that cycle.

### 2. Data Acquisition and Feature Generation
* Safe currency pairs are processed using the `twelvedata` API to fetch 5,000 days of historical O-H-L-C data.
* The data is augmented with over 30 technical and statistical features, including: Lagged Prices (Lags 1-5), Exponential/Simple Moving Averages, Volatility Channels (Bollinger, Keltner), and Momentum Oscillators.

### 3. Ensemble Prediction Model

The system employs three specialized **XGBoost Regressors** trained to maximize predictive stability:

| Model | Primary Focus & Feature Set | Training Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model A** | Core Time-Series Features (Lag, MA, Change %) | Uses cross-validation (`GridSearchCV`) on a split set for robust parameter optimization. |
| **Model B** | Comprehensive Technical Indicators (Full suite of 30+ indicators) | Designed to capture broad market sentiment and support/resistance levels. |
| **Model C** | Validation and Trend Confirmation | Trained on the full historical dataset to provide a baseline prediction against which Models A and B are validated. |

### 4. Signal Consensus and Delivery

A trade signal is only generated if the predicted closing price ($\hat{P}_{\text{next}}$) meets the following stringent criteria across **all three models**:

* **Directional Agreement:** All three models must predict a Long or all three must predict a Short.
* **Threshold Adherence:** The predicted Percentage Change ($P_{\text{Change}}$) must fall within a high-confidence range to minimize noise:
    * **Long:** $0.08\% < P_{\text{Change}} < 0.33\%$
    * **Short:** $-0.33\% < P_{\text{Change}} < -0.08\%$

Final signals are delivered to stakeholders via a dedicated Discord Webhook using the `requests` library.

## 💻 Environment & Deployment

The entire pipeline is containerized implicitly via GitHub Actions and executed daily at **22:05 UTC**. All sensitive credentials (`TWELVEDATA_API_KEY`, `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`) are securely managed via **GitHub Repository Secrets**, adhering to best practices for production environment security.
